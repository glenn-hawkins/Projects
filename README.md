This project was undertaken at the request of one of my professors in the Economics department at Sophia University. The goal was to provide an internal platform to manage a database of working papers produced by the faculty. Any database information is not included.

All code and graphics were created completely by me.

Tools used: Adobe Dreamweaver, NotePad++, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator
